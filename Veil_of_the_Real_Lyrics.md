## 🎶 Lyrics

### [Intro] (Whispered / Chanted)
Form is emptiness... emptiness is form  
The rope is not a snake... the dream is not the dawn  
What we call real... is only what we cling to...

---

### Verse 1  
I walked through a world of mirrors and flame,  
Chasing names, chasing shapes, all the same.  
The mountain spoke: “This too shall pass,”  
Even stone is a story that will not last.

A wave that rises must fall again,  
A sky of silence behind the rain.  
Each breath dissolves, each thought unwinds,  
What is yours? What is mine?

---

### [Chorus] (Invocation)  
🎶  
Maya, oh Maya, the veil that blinds the eyes  
Show me what is changeless beneath the changing skies  
Dreamer, awaken — this world is a play  
The real cannot leave, the false cannot stay  
🎶

---

### Verse 2  
A bubble in the stream, a lightning flash,  
Time and form in a holy clash.  
Is this the self — or just a sound?  
When I looked within, no "I" was found.

Who sees the seer? Who dreams the dream?  
The echo fades, but who cast the beam?  
The more I searched, the less I knew,  
The closer I came to what’s ever true.

---

### [Bridge] (Slow, Spacious)  
🎵  
All things arise, then fade away...  
The world appears, but does not stay.  
Like a star at dawn, or a phantom sigh,  
All we know is born to die...

---

### [Chorus] (Repeat / Build)  
🎶  
Maya, oh Maya, the veil that blinds the eyes  
Show me what is deathless beneath the dream and lie  
Dreamer, awaken — the Self never sleeps  
In silence it watches, in stillness it speaks  
🎶

---

### Verse 3 (Revelation)  
I am not this body, not this breath,  
Not thought, nor name, nor even death.  
What I am was never born —  
The unborn light before the dawn.

Brahman shines in the darkest hour,  
No fear, no end, no separate power.  
The rope, the snake — now clear to see,  
There never was a “you” or “me.”

---

### [Outro] (Soft Whisper / Fade)  
You are not a drop... you are the ocean  
You are not the motion... you are the stillness  
All things pass... but You remain...  
The Real behind the name...
